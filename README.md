# Chess Game

Welcome to the **Chess Game** project! This real-time multiplayer chess game allows two players to compete against each other while other users can join as spectators. The project leverages a range of modern web technologies to provide a seamless and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Gameplay**: Players can compete in real-time thanks to Socket.io.
- **Spectator Mode**: Users can join and watch ongoing games without participating.
- **Modern UI**: Utilizes TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **Chess Mechanics**: Powered by Chess.js to handle game rules and move validation.
- **Server-side Logic**: Built with Node.js and Express to manage game states and player interactions.
- **Dynamic Templating**: EJS is used for rendering dynamic content on the front-end.

## Technologies Used

- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating.
- **Chess.js**: A JavaScript library for chess move generation, validation, and other utility functions.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
